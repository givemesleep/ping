<p style ="text-indent:50px;textalignment:center"> I was born in a very religous family surrounded by people who truly love her and spoils her with the word of God. Due to my health condition, my parents decided to bring me to our province, Romblon. My father was left alone here in Manila, while me, my mother and my brother moved to our province for eleven years. There I had a three girls cousins in my mother side namely Sunshine, Francine and Susette Cutay which is also my bestfriends. In addition, I also have a neighborhoods that treats me like their own daughter or sister.

<h1 style="text-align:left;"> PRE-SCHOOL </h1>
<p style ="text-indent:50px;textalignment:center"> When I was a pre-schooler, I studied at Golder Star Tutorial Learning Center under the advisory of Mrs. Elizabeth Barez. It is a private learning center that teaches advance lessons. At the age of five, I learned how to read faster, spell simple words since I reads books a lot, write, and solve basic maths. I also was competetive pupil back then, I ranked third place in our class. I was a shy girl and also a daddy's girl and I love it when my father accompanied me and wait for me at our school. My most memorable part back then was, it was my ID picture taking day and a coincidence, my mother was not available that time to groom me that is my father did it all, fed me, choose my uniform, and also the one who ties me a ponytail and as expected, it didn't looked too good. I was throwing a tantrums because I don't want to take a picture and the result made it my most memorable moment.</p>

<h1 style="text-align:left;"> ELEMENTARY </h1>
<p> In my Grade 1, I studied at Kalayaan Elementary School and was an achiever, ranking fifth place in my class. But due to my health condition, my parents decided to send me in our province also because of their financial issues. My journer during my elementary days was not as good as I expected. I was bullied and was hated by my classmates. iInspite of that situation, she manage to became an achiever and a competitive pupil. Grade 2 to Geade 3, I was a consistent first placer in our class. I am also active contestant, I joined contest such as Science Quizbee, Spelling Quizbee, MTAP, Girls Scout. In addition, I beacame a champion in the District Science Quizbee in my third grade and proceeded to the next stage which is the Division Science Quizbee located at San Andres, Romblon and I won a third place. I also became a contestant in Quizbees but unfortunately I never won again and get only third or fifth places.</p><br>
<p> Grade 4 to Grade 6 I was a consistent honor student but only a second placer but my grades are well maintained. In my Grade 5 era, I began to laid my interest on guitar and started to learn it from my mother. She taught me few chords and I learned the rest by myself. By my 6thy Grade, my skills upgraded since I practiced a lot and was also participated at choir contest. I was a very active pupil back then making me graduated as a Salutatorian in  my Elementary journey. Before graduating on Elementary, our adviser advised us to take an entrance exam to become one of the students in Special Science Class in Alcantara National High School wherein a special section that will luckily acquire advanced lessons such as gaing a special subject, thr "RESARCH" </p>

<h1 style="text-align:left;"> JUNIOR HIGHSCHOOL </h1>
<p> I entered my journey as a highschool with an honored and a happy heart because I passed the exam for being one of the students in Special Science Class. During my 7th year, I wasn't that active because I am still adjusting and was very shy to participate. My grades are not that good that is very not used to it, I feel disappointed as well as my parents. But when the half of the school year starts, I gained some confidence and started to accept my environment. I started to participate in discussions, improves my communication skills, and I was able to show off my knowledge and skills. Until my 8th Grade, I was one of the honor students and became competetive as before. That was the era I was starting to create and make my surname be known at the campus. I became quite popular since I joined again into Quizbees. I remember when there was an English Quizbee and I was a champion in a District stage but wasn't able to moved to the next stage for some reasons.</p><br>
<p>In my 9th Grade, I joined the club named "THE BEACON" where in they made literatures, news and activities related to disseminating information  including newscasting, collaborative newspaper making, editorial, radiobroadcasting, postermaking and many more. I was once in a team of a collaborative newspapermaking. In that opportunity, I was enabled to enhanced my writing skills and critical thinking since it was all about facts. In my 10th Grade, I was never been out of the honor roll, I maintained everything and work myself out to became better and of course to make myself and parents proud. In mjy journey in a Special Science Class, I was able to advance in a subject research that is very in demand in today's curriculum.</p>

<h1 style="text-align:left;"> SENIOR HIGHSCHOOL </h1>
<p> I took a Senior High School strand, Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics. My competency as a student remained and maintained my place and I also upgraded my learning capacities. Research is very in demand that time, it is about two to three research we made in a year. It really enhances my capability to speak in front.I participated again in Beacon contest and got 7th place.</p><br>
<p> In my 12th Grade, pandemic happenned but inspite of that situation, I still maintained my performance. In that era, our adviser still managed to conduct a research capstone that we easily made since we already did that before.</p>

<p> I am currently studying at Colegio de Sta Teresa de Avila, second year, taking a Bachelor in Science of Information Technology program. San Roque Parish offered a free education to the aspiring students who are willing to study at the said school where I met the love of my life Justice Bellen. In fact, the quality of education here is very high standard that will surely enhances students' capacities and capabilities.
